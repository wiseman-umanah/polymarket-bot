# PolySignal

A Telegram bot that monitors active [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) prediction markets, detects unusual price and volume activity, and delivers real-time alerts to anyone who subscribes.

---

## How it works

Every 30 seconds the bot fetches the top 100 most-active markets from Polymarket's public API. For each market it stores a snapshot and runs three signal checks:

| Signal | Condition |
|---|---|
| 📈 Price movement | Price shifted ±4%+ compared to 5 minutes ago |
| 📊 Volume spike | Current volume is 2×+ the recent rolling average |
| 🚨 Strong signal | Both conditions fire at the same time |

When a signal fires, the bot broadcasts an alert to every subscriber. Each market has a 15-minute cooldown per signal type to prevent spam.

---

## Alert format

```
🚨 STRONG SIGNAL

Market : Will BTC reach $200k by end of 2026?
Price  : 64.2%
Move   : UP +6.2%
Volume : $1,234,567
Signal : Price moved 4%+ and volume spiked 2×+

```

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the token you receive — it looks like `123456789:ABC-DEF...`

### 3. Get your Telegram chat ID (for `ADMIN_CHAT_ID`)

Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram. It will reply with your numeric ID.

### 4. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in at minimum:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=your_numeric_id_here
```

### 5. Run

```bash
uv run polymarket-bot
```

Or directly:

```bash
uv run python -m bot
```

The bot starts in **polling mode** locally (no webhook needed). It will log to `bot.log` and print status to stdout.

---

## Railway deployment

Railway is the recommended hosting platform. It provides free PostgreSQL and a public HTTPS URL.

### 1. Create a new Railway project

Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and create a new empty project.

### 2. Add a PostgreSQL database

In your project dashboard → **New** → **Database** → **PostgreSQL**.
Railway automatically injects `DATABASE_URL` into your service's environment.

### 3. Deploy the bot

Connect your GitHub repository to Railway or push via the Railway CLI:

```bash
railway up
```

### 4. Set environment variables

In Railway → your service → **Variables**, add:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=your_numeric_id_here
```

All other settings have sensible defaults. See [BOT.md](BOT.md) for the full reference.

### 5. Add a webhook URL

Once the service is deployed, Railway gives you a public URL under the **Domains** tab (e.g. `https://polymarket-bot.up.railway.app`).

Add it as an environment variable:

```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://polymarket-bot.up.railway.app
```

Save → Railway restarts the service → the bot switches from polling to webhook mode automatically and registers the URL with Telegram.

### Health check

The bot runs a lightweight HTTP server on `HEALTH_PORT` (default `8080`) that returns `200 OK`. Configure Railway's health check to hit that port if needed.

## Configuration reference

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed. See [BOT.md](BOT.md) for a detailed explanation of every setting.

## Troubleshooting

**Not receiving alerts**
- Send `/start` to the bot — you must subscribe first
- Check `bot.log` for errors
- Temporarily lower `PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD=0.01` to confirm the pipeline works
- Test Telegram connectivity:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage \
    -d chat_id=<YOUR_ID> -d text="test"
  ```

**Bot started but nothing happens**
- Run `/status` — if it replies, the bot is alive and polling
- Run `/thresholds` to confirm settings are loaded correctly
- Markets need a few poll cycles before signals can fire (the lookback window needs data)

**Webhook not working on Railway**
- Confirm `WEBHOOK_URL` is set to your Railway public domain (no trailing slash)
- Check that the domain is active under the **Domains** tab in Railway
- The bot logs `Webhook mode — port X` on startup if it registered correctly

**Quiet hours not working**
- Hours are in UTC. Use `/mystats` to confirm your saved settings.
